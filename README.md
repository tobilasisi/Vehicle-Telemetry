Standard .html based website isntallation.  

Acquire Google Cloud Platform and create one of their SQL servers, potentially using their free trial version
Have the server execute /db/fedex-db-setup.sql, potentially add dummy data with /db/fedex-db-dummy-data.sql
Modify the values in /php/db_creds.php so that it can access your server.
From there, accessing index.html should allow full access to the site.

Other hosting options also work, but still require the modification of /php/db_creds.php
